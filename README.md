# DogBreedClassifier

## Part 1
A deep learning based image classifier using TensorFlow that classifies an image of a dog among 120 dog breeds. It uses the MobileNet V2 model from TFHub. Made for the final udemy project in the Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery course and submitted in the kaggle contest as a late submission.

## Part 2
Deployment of the classification model built in the previous step on an android app using android studio. The model is converted to MobileNet V2 lite for using it in an android app. The app runs a camera activity and provides top 5 breeds with highest confidence level from the image received from camera in real time.
